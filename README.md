# CSV-project
 hi, this is my csv file reader.
 The goal of this program is to read a csv-file with many people and organize them by name, age or gender. This also has a plot with the amount of different genders there are.

 # How to use it.

 You just upload a csv-file with all the data and the program does the rest.
