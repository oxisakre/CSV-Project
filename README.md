# CSV-project
 Hi, this is my csv file reader.\
 The goal of this program is to read a csv-file with many people and organize them by name, age or gender. This also has a plot with the amount of different genders there are.

## How to use it
 You need to have Python installed.\
 Download the project, then open the command prompt in the 'CSV project\CSV' (where the 'manage.py' is) and type ' Python3 manage.py runserver'.\
 Upload a csv-file with all the data, written in this way ---> Name,Gender,Birthdate.
