# CSV-project
 hi, this is my csv file reader.
 The goal of this program is to read a csv-file with many people and organize them by name, age or gender. This also has a plot with the amount of different genders there are.

## How to use it

* [Open-Project](CSV\templates\main.html)
 You just upload a csv-file with all the data and the program does the rest.

## Built With

* [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/)
