# CSV-project
* Hi, this is my csv file reader.\
* The goal of this program is to read a csv-file with many people and organize them by name, age or gender.
* This also has a plot with the amount of different genders there are.

## How to use it
* You need to have Python installed.\
* Download the project, then open the command prompt in the 'CSV project\CSV' (where the 'manage.py' is) and type ' Python3 manage.py runserver'.\
* Upload a csv-file with all the data, written in this way ---> Name,Gender,Birthdate.\
* Gender have to be (Male or M, Female or F, Other or O) and Birthdate (Year-Month-Day Hour:Minutes:Seconds)\
* Example: 'Sean Kingston,Male,1990-01-29 16:32:00' (if you don't know the time, just put 00:00:00)


## Example
1) Open the server typing the runserver command and opening the link\
